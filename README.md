# Using Computer Vision for Control of a Rotary Inverted Pendulum System - Code Repository
A repo of thesis material for Sigur√∞ur Jakobsson

## CAD
Autodesk Inventor files for device covers and thesis diagrams.

## cameraCalibration
Code that is similar to the camera portion of the main control code.  Can be used to train the camera on the pendulum while it is controlled by a different application.
This is useful for tuning camera parameters that can then be copied to the main code.

## dataAndTesting

Contains various types of data and test scripts.

### mainTestLogs
The logs from the main statistical trials of the project

### matlabAnalysis
Contains various materials used for controller gain calculations, signal analysis, and model analysis.  The most important and useful scripts are mentioned in the thesis.
The testing scripts for chapter 5 are labeled as such.  A few test scripts that did not make the thesis are included in case they may be of interest to someone.
Dated project logs are contained in subfolders.

### TestData.xlsx
An Excel file collecting terminal output logs for analysis.

### TestCalculations.xlsx
An Excel file containing calculations for TestData.xlsx.

## qubeCameraControl
The main application code.  Consult the thesis for a detailed description of functionality and Appendix C for setup help.

## UML
Contains UML code used to generate diagrams in the thesis.
